# My ToDo

In this project, I learnt how to make a REST API with an SQL database and JWT authentication.

Next, I added to this project by adding a frontend using NextJS, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI.

Finally, to take this project further, I used Docker Compose to make this project containerised to help me learn Docker and Docker Compose.

## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  docker compose up
```

If you have made changes and have previously launched docker compose, use the following commands.

```bash
  docker compose down
  docker compose up --build
```
